# Exemplary BPMN processes

This project contains multiple exemplary BPMN processes.
You can execute these processes without modifications in d.velop process.

Two steps are necessary to execute a process:

1. Deploying the process
2. Starting the process


## Requirements

In order to view the files of the exemplary processes, you need a text or BPMN editor with XML view.
You can also use the editor to modify the processes.

In order to start the processes, you need a tool to call a REST API.


## Deploying the process

You can deploy the processes in the process administration of d.velop process.


## Starting the process

You can start a deployed process with the REST API of d.velop process.
You can find information on the URI, HTTP headers and the content in the process administration of d.velop process as soon as you have deployed the process.
